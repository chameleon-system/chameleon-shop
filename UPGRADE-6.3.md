# Deprecated Code Entities

It is recommended that all references to the classes, interfaces, properties, constants, methods and services in the
following list are removed from the project, as they will be removed in Chameleon 7.0. The deprecation notices in the
code will tell if there are replacements for the deprecated entities or if the functionality is to be entirely removed.

To search for deprecated code usage, [SensioLabs deprecation detector](https://github.com/sensiolabs-de/deprecation-detector)
is recommended (although this tool may not find database-related deprecations).
