# Chameleon System ShopPaymentIpnBundle

This bundle manages instant payment notifications from payment providers.

Some important notes:

- the IPN Trigger expects an answer with header 200 and body containing "OK"
- the triggers are executed using the cronjobs - so there will be some delay caused by the cron-job schedule
- retrigger schedule is as follows (after 10 failed trigger calls, Chameleon will give up)
