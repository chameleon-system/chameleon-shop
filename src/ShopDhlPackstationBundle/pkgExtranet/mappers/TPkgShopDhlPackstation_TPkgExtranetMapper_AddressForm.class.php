     * To map values from models to views the mapper has to implement iVisitable.
     * The ViewRender will pass a prepared MapeprVisitor instance to the mapper.
     *
     * The mapper has to fill the values it is responsible for in the visitor.
     *
     * example:
     *
     * $foo = $oVisitor->GetSourceObject("foomodel")->GetFoo();
     * $oVisitor->SetMapperValue("foo", $foo);
     *
     *
     * To be able to access the desired source object in the visitor, the mapper has
     * to declare this requirement in its GetRequirements method (see IViewMapper)
     *
     * @param bool $bCachingEnabled - if set to true, you need to define your cache trigger that invalidate the view rendered via mapper. if set to false, you should NOT set any trigger
