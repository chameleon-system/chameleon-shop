# Shop Module ArticleList

## Description

The module shows a product selection based on a per instance configurable filter definition. The Result is pageable and sortable.

## View logic (and ajax paging)

For ajax paging we need to get the articles without the module content. To support this, we introduced a method that renders just that part (it includes caching). It will search for mappers using the view name under the mapper chain configuration of the module. The mapper configuration itself for the views should be reduced to mappers that prepare data relevant for the list surrounding the article list.

The view used for the article list is currently hardcoded in the module class as a mapping from view name to article list snippet name. This will need to change.

Please note, that you need to map the template name used for the module to the view you want to use for the list of products rendered within the list. You can do that by setting `chameleon_system_shop.article_list.view_to_list_view_mapping` in your `config.yml`.

### Example

```yaml
parameters:
  chameleon_system_shop.article_list.view_to_list_view_mapping:
    rightNoticeList:           "/common/lists/listStandardShopArticle.html.twig"
    full:                      "/common/lists/listExtendedShopArticle.html.twig"
    standardEmptyOnNoArticles: "/common/lists/listScrollShopArticle.html.twig"
    standard:                  "/common/lists/listScrollShopArticle.html.twig"
```

## Extending the module

The module can be extended by providing state request extractors and result modifications.

### Changing state variables

If you want to change the behaviour of the list, you tend to need two things:

a) a way to add additional information into the lists state
b) a way to modify the lists results based on the lists state

#### state request extractor

The state request extractor takes the request data sent to the module (any post/get data sent to spotName).

Example: `spotName[foo]=bar` would sent `foo=bar` to the extractor

You should register a new request extractor whenever any of the request data sent to the module should affect the modules state.

An example would be if you want to provide the user with the ability to select a page size. This would require a new state parameter which would need to be injected into the state.

State request extractors must implement the `StateRequestExtractorInterface` and must be tagged with `chameleon_system_shop.article_list_module.state_extractor`.

#### state element

A state element implements `StateElementInterface` and must be tagged with `chameleon_system_shop.article_list_module.state_element`. Every state element defines under what key the state element will be available in the state, a method to validate the input, and a method to normalize incoming data

#### result modifications

If you want to change the result of the list you should provide a result modification service that extends `ResultModificationInterface` tag the Service with `chameleon_system_shop.result_modifier`.

#### page size

All allowed page sizes must be configured via `chameleon_system_shop.state_factory.state_element_valid_page_sizes`. Example (for a `config.yml`):

```yaml
parameters:
  chameleon_system_shop.state_factory.state_element_valid_page_sizes:
    - 5
    - 10
    - 15
```

### Example

You can check the `pkgshoplistfilter` bundle as an example where the lists state is extended and the result are modified based on this.

### Summary

| type                   | implements                    | auto registered via tag                                  |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| State request extractor | `StateRequestExtractorInterface` | `chameleon_system_shop.article_list_module.state_extractor` |
| State element          | `StateElementInterface`       | `chameleon_system_shop.article_list_module.state_element`   |
| Result modification    | `ResultModificationInterface` | `chameleon_system_shop.result_modifier`                    |

## Twig Variables

- items - array with `TdbShopArticle` holding all products for the page to be displayed
- itemsMappedData array with the mapped data for every item. contents of each item depends on the mapper used
- results - `ChameleonSystem\ShopBundle\objects\ArticleList\ResultData` holds the result data. is made available to be processed by other mappers
- listPagerUrl - url string that can be used to generate the url for a specific page. Replace the `_pageNumber_` with the page you would like to open
- listPageSizeChangeUrl - url string that can be used to generate a url that will switch to a different page size. Replace `_pageSize_` with the page size you would like to change to.
- numberOfPages - total number of pages
- state - array with state values (includes default values). relevant keys are p (current page), s (sort id), ps (page size)
- stateObject - the original state object. you should not use it in your views - use the state array instead
- listTitle
- description_start
- description_end
- shop the shop object
- currency current currency object
- local active local object
- sModuleSpotName
- listConfiguration list configuration object
- activeSortId active sort id
- sortFormStateInputFields the state to pass along when changing the order
- sortFormAction action of the sort form
- sortFieldName sort field name
- sortList (id, name) - sort elements (array with sub arrays each with id and name)
